Project's Purpose or Goal: The project is a chrome extension to help users spend time effectively when browsing the internet, by setting a timer for specific websites that prompts users to reflect on how long they've browsed, and what the goal of that browsing is.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

A timer that starts on certain urls
A simple UI that allows picking web urls to track, and setting timer length
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

Chrome manifest V2
Javascript ES6
HTML5
CSS
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Mood tracking element, that records self reported moods at end of timer
Statistics on websites visited and time spent browsing 
A way to add webpages to a list, or specify a certain page, to be loaded or linked to when the timer goes off(for instance a music video the user likes)
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

TBD
